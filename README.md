## About Me

I’m a developer on the path to becoming a **Native iOS Developer**, mainly working with **Swift**.

Academically, I study **Management Information Systems**. Alongside improving my technical skills, I’m also developing myself in:

-  Project management  
-  Team management  
-  Product-oriented thinking  

Flutter is currently more of a hobby for me, while my professional focus is Swift and native iOS development.

I believe great software is built not only with good code, but also with proper planning and strong teamwork.
